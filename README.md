18th May - 
Today I met (on a google meet) with Rbhu Gandhi, Shresht Venkatraman and Ayushi Bhandari. This is the provisional team for the hackathon, we formed through networking on Linkedin. Rbhu has a background in software development, NLP and chemical engineering and is based in the US. Shresht has a background in economics and more recently data science and is also in the US. Ayushi has a background in chemistry, pursusing a data science masters, with a more strategic consulting direction and is based in Paris. My background is in pure and applied math, with some elementary data science. We spoke about which of the three challenges that are proposed we would pursue, as well as how we could communicate. We decided on challenge #2 "Remixing Data and Recommerce". As this seemed to give the largest opportunity to create a unique solution due to its open-endedness. WhatsApp was chosen as the mode of communication. We also decided that since we don't have information on what data will be given to us by VISA, when the competition opens (28th of May), we would each choose an area of recommerce to conduct market research and try and find gaps in the market that we could capitalise on. The areas given by VISA are repair, resale, rent, resdistribute, refill, return. I chose to go after repair and refill. 

Main takeaways: 
1. Weekly meetings on Saturdays at 6pm (GMT).
2. Conduct research on the industry of repair and the indsutry of refill
3. Stay in contact with the team on WhatsApp.
